                <hr>
            <p>
              In this chapter, I want to cover the field of digital investment platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a space that is seeing innovation at lightning speeds.
              </p>
              <p>
              Let's have a look at the Top 7 innovators. The list includes both digital enablers - those that are creating the technology that other companies can build on top of - as well as those companies that are targeting the end-user directly.
              </p>
              <p>
              a) Xignite - Just about all the "robo-advisors" use this company's live market feeds. In order to provide customers with the true value of their investment portfolio online, the program needs to know, at any given time, the value of every given asset. That's where Xignite comes in. They provide the live market price, which automatically syncs with any platform's User Experience.
              </p>
              <p>
              b) Apex - Apex is a clearing service. When an Average Joe sitting at home buys a stock online, the trade is not executed immediately. Apex receives the orders, and guarantees that the transaction takes place between the buyer and seller. Clearing services are filled with regulation requirements - and when it comes to enabling digital trading platforms, Apex is at the center of keeping the platforms regulated, legit, and reliable. </p>
            <p>
              c) Tradier - If you want to launch a service similar to Ameritrade, or E-trade, at low startup costs, then Tradier is for you. They take care of everything related to brokering the deal, and the regulation around it. There are tons of unique investment platforms currently building off of their technology (via their API). In another article, I hope to cover the subject of "What the heck is an API... And why you should care."<hr>

              <hr>
              <p>
              d) Portfolio Checkup - Everybody has heard about Tony Robbins - Mr. Banana Hands / Motivational speaker extraordinaire. While writing his most recent book "Money: Master the Game," he happened to "accidentally" create a service called "Portfolio Checkup". He wrote in his book that anyone can log on to this site, upload their investment portfolio automatically, and have the system provide personalized recommendations which would save the investor money. The system also connects the investor with a local financial advisor. Here's the amazing part, though, according to Investmentnews.com: "Since mid-November, Portfolio Checkup has garnered more than 500 accounts, representing $4 billion in assets."
            </p>
            <p>
              e) Motif Investing - This site is awesome. Users can choose to invest in specific themes. For example, if you want to invest in companies likely to be affected by Obamacare, you can buy the "Obamacare" motif, which contains a basket of about 30 stocks - all with one click. Great concept. Motifs also exist for "High-dividend stocks," "BioMed," "Solar Energy," and just about anything you can think of.
              </p>
              <p>

              f) Wealthfront - This is another B2C investment platform. The last I heard they had $2.6 Billion USD in assets under management. They allow users to take a quiz before investing, analyzing their risk-tolerance. They also have features they call "tax-loss harvesting" built directly into their platform. This means the government is less likely to eat up your profits via taxes. Did I mention that they have Burton Malkiel as their Chief Investment Officer? That's the guy that wrote "A Random Walk Down Wall Street," and pretty much invented the ability to invest in index funds - giving more diversification, and lower fees, than investing in individual stocks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Have a look at Wealthfront's CEO, Adam Nash, discussing in May 2014, how the company raised $700 million in AUM in one year (P.S. They've raised a lot more since).
            </p>

              <hr>
              <p>
              g) Betterment - From what I understand this seems to be an identical service to Wealthfront - A digital investment service with automated features, yada, yada, yada. I really like what they're doing with their automated emails sent to those that expressed interest but haven't deposited yet. Click here to have a look.
              </p>

             <h3>Summary</h3>

             <p>
              Anywhoo, I hope I've successfully made the argument that if you're a financial advisor, you should be paying close attention to the methods by which people are choosing to invest their money.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whereas in the past, people began their search for an advisor by asking close friends, nowadays "Google" has become an equally attractive, and perhaps even more trusted source.
              </p>
              <p>
              Advisors need to utilize the power of these platforms, and adjust their game if they want to stay relevant.
